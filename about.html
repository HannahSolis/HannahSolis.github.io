            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate from the UPVM in the career of IT engineering. I'm currently building up my skillset and working towards a proficient programming career.</p>
            <p>I have recently graduated from the Polytechnic University of Mexico as an Information Technologies Engineer. I possess accreditations in both languages object oriented and web development. </p>
			<p>My job experience has been in internships at different enterprises that allowed to delve in the development of projects related to geolocalization programming. I have worked with languages such as Python, Java and JavaScript frameworks (Node.JS and React Native). Iâ€™m fully capable of working with a wide range of relational database motors (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and I as well have a certified B2 level in the English language.</p>
